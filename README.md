Nimble Programming Language
==============

Nimble is aimed to be a general purpose fast and effective open-source programming language using constructs from C++, C# and java. It's a first time experiment hoping to be a useful language. 

The basic goal of Nimble is to provide a fast yet powerful and easy to use language. It's aimed to take effective and useful constructs from various languages which have been found useful to programmers and to implement them in this language to provide and powerful language which saves programmers time which can be better spent on coding projects to their hearts desire.

The approach to build Nimble is to research programming language constructs which can be implemented into Nimble. Nimble however is a Experiment and a Project combined that if it takes off could become a full fledged programming language used by a large number of people. The goal is to take effective programming language practices and implement them into Nimble. The language will be compiled using a C++ program, converting the code into assembly and then using NASM, GAS and possibly AS.

Goals
==============
Implement a fast and easy to use programming language.
Compiled code to various platforms such as: Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows(as many version as possible)
Include generic collections library
Include graphics library
Include GUI library
Include concurrency
Include database handling.

About Me
==============
Hi I'm Daniel Rigby and i'm a coder. I have experience in C++, Java, PHP, Javascript and various other languages. I have a broad knowledge of the fundamentals to code but lack experience on the corporate side of things and am using this project to further my knowledge in programming, assembly, open-source projects, version control(as i have been rather slack in this area).

I love coding and am pursing software developing as a career. Apart from coding i enjoy music and have a love for watching sports.

Want to Help?
==============
If you're interested in helping out and working on this project for me, send me an email to: danielrigby@gmail.com
I'm currently looking for others who are interested in developing libraries and coming up with ideas and research for this programming language. Those who are able to implement GUI features across platforms like Java has would be an important priority at this stage.
