Nimble Programming Language
==============

Nimble is aimed to be a general purpose fast and effective open-sourced programming language using constructs from C++, C# and java and other powerful and versatile programming language. It's a first time experiment hoping to be a useful language. 

The basic goal of Nimble is to provide a fast yet powerful and easy to use language. It's aimed to take effective and useful constructs from various languages which have been found useful to programmers and to implement them in this language to provide a powerful language which saves programmers time, pain, and sweat which can be better spent on creatively coding and solving problems producing efficient, working, and beautiful code furthering projects which may have been slowed down by lower level languages and hampered by inefficient or higher level languages which produce bloated or slower code.

The approach to build Nimble is to research programming language constructs which can be implemented into Nimble. Nimble however is a Experiment and a Project combined that if it takes off could become a full fledged programming language used by a large number of people. The goal is to take effective programming language practices and implement them into Nimble. The language will be compiled using a C++ program, converting the code into assembly and then using NASM, GAS and possibly AS. The language will become fast by using C/C++ type constructs which will be optional to allow for improved speeds such as pointers if necessary, optiona/manual garbage handling and other features.

Goals
==============
Implement a fast and easy to use programming language.
Compiled code to various platforms such as: Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows(as many version as possible)
Include generic collections library
Include graphics library
Include GUI library
Include concurrency
Include database handling.

About Me
==============
Hi I'm Daniel Rigby and i'm a coder. I have experience in C++, Java, PHP, Javascript and various other languages. I have a broad knowledge of the fundamentals of coding but lack experience on the corporate sized projects and am using this project to further my knowledge in programming, assembly, open-source projects, version control and whatever else i may learn along this path.

I love coding and am pursing software developing as a career. Whilst doing this project i hope to obtain many important skills in the coding universe and hope to expand my reportoire and work with others on this project.

Apart from coding i enjoy music and am learning the guitar and play the piano and have a love for sports, though i admit i watch sports more than play them but a goal of mine is to take up a sports in me free time!

Want to Help?
==============
I'm currently looking for others who are interested in developing libraries and coming up with ideas and research for this programming language. Those who are able to implement GUI features across platforms like Java has would be an important priority at this stage as well as previous experience and knowledge about programming languages and in particular compilers.

If you're interested in helping out and working on this project for me, send me an email to: danielrigby@gmail.com. Tell me about your experience coding, what projects you have worked on, how you will be a useful contribution and what you can offer and why you want to join the team.

At this stage i'm planning to keep it limited to a simple terminal compiler, if this project gets off the ground with good support i may be looking for someone interested in developing a simple or further along the path a powerful IDE for the language. So email me if you're interested in this as well.
